# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in C

This project is a menu-driven C program that simulates the following CPU scheduling algorithms:

* First-Come First-Served (FCFS)
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Round Robin Scheduling
* Priority Scheduling
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
* Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)

The program reads the input from a file and outputs the following information:

* Average turnaround time
* Average waiting time
* Gantt chart
